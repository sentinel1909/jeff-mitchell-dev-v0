I have been learning Rust off and on for the past two years. My confidence in the language has steadily increased in the past two or three months. In September, I wrote what I now lovingly refer to as "the dumbest Rust program ever".

The repo on GitHub is here: [TextArchiver](https://github.com/sentinel1909/textarchiver)

I have not commented the program (bad habits die hard) but I think it is pretty self-explanatory as is.

The significance of this program for me cannot be overstated. It was the first time I sat down and coded something from beginning to end that was not rooted in a tutorial. I thought of something I wanted to do and sat down and banged out the code which achieved it. I wanted to create something which took a couple of pieces of text as command line arguments and save them into a file as key-value pairs.

I had it done in about an hour. I consulted mainly the Rust by Example book, the Rust standard library documentation, and I will not lie, a bit of Stack Overflow. Otherwise, it was mine.

To have the Rust compiler come back clean after coding the last few lines and running the first time felt amazing, and I will remember it for a long time.

This dumb little program literally put me over the moon.

It was a terrific day.

Rust is a tough language, it can be very demanding and unforgiving. I love that it makes me think. Rust makes me feel empowered to make something significant, with a high probability of producing something inherently safe.

I wish more people would jump on board with this marvellous tool. The software quality in the world would automatically improve and we would all be better for it.
The "aha" moment I had with this programming exercise was repeated a little bit later when I cracked the other big thing giving me grief…deployment in a Windows Server environment. More about that another time…
